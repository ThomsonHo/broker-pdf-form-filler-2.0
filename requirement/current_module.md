# Current Module: PDF Form Filler

## Overview
The PDF Form Filler module is responsible for generating filled PDF forms based on client data. It provides functionality for selecting form templates, mapping client data to form fields, generating filled forms, and managing form batches.

## Tasks to Complete

### Backend
- [ ] Create PDF templates directory structure
- [ ] Implement PDF form filling service with PyPDFForm and pdfrw
- [ ] Implement field mapping logic
- [ ] Implement form generation batch management
- [ ] Implement form download functionality
- [ ] Implement form retention policy
- [ ] Implement form quota management
- [ ] Implement form preview functionality
- [ ] Implement form editing functionality
- [ ] Implement form validation
- [ ] Implement form error handling
- [ ] Implement form logging
- [ ] Implement form security
- [ ] Implement form testing

### Frontend
- [ ] Implement form template selection
- [ ] Implement form preview
- [ ] Implement form download
- [ ] Implement form batch management
- [ ] Implement form quota display
- [ ] Implement form error handling
- [ ] Implement form loading states
- [ ] Implement form validation
- [ ] Implement form testing

## Next Steps
1. Create PDF templates directory structure
2. Implement PDF form filling service
3. Implement field mapping logic
4. Implement form generation batch management
5. Implement form download functionality
6. Implement form retention policy
7. Implement form quota management
8. Implement form preview functionality
9. Implement form editing functionality
10. Implement form validation
11. Implement form error handling
12. Implement form logging
13. Implement form security
14. Implement form testing

## Notes
- The PDF Form Filler module will use PyPDFForm as the primary library with pdfrw as a fallback
- The module will enforce daily (10 sets) and monthly usage quotas per user
- The module will ensure form generation performance meets 5 seconds per form requirement
- The module will address Chinese character rendering issues identified in previous system
- The module will use the standardized fields structure as defined in standardized_fields.json
