# Implementation Clarification Questionnaire with Responses

## Purpose
This questionnaire aims to collect detailed information about specific aspects of the project that require further clarification before implementation. Your responses will help ensure that the development team has a clear understanding of expectations and requirements for complex features.

## Timeline and Resource Planning

1. **Timeline Estimation**
   - What is the expected project duration from start to completion?
     [The complete project is expected to take 6 months from May 2025 to November 2025.]
   - Are there any specific milestone deadlines that must be met?
     [Phase 1 (Authentication, Dashboard, Client Management) must be completed by July 31, 2025. Phase 2 (PDF Form Filler, LLM Integration) must be completed by October 15, 2025. Final deployment and training should be completed by November 30, 2025.]
   - Is the project expected to be delivered in phases? If so, please outline the phases and their priorities.
     [Yes, three phases: Phase 1 (Authentication, Dashboard, Client Management), Phase 2 (PDF Form Filler, LLM Integration), Phase 3 (Admin features, Reporting, Final Deployment).]

2. **Resource Allocation**
   - How many developers are expected to work on this project?
     [A team of 5 developers: 2 frontend, 2 backend, and 1 DevOps/database specialist.]
   - Will there be dedicated resources for frontend, backend, and database development?
     [Yes, as noted above. The backend developers will share database responsibilities with the dedicated database specialist.]
   - Is there a project manager or product owner who will be the primary point of contact?
     [Yes, there is a dedicated project manager who will coordinate with stakeholders and manage the development roadmap.]

## Technical Decision Points

3. **Backend Framework Selection**
   - The requirements mention both Django and Flask as options. Which framework is preferred and why?
     [Django is preferred due to its comprehensive ORM, built-in admin interface, and authentication system which aligns with our user management requirements.]
   - Are there any specific features of either framework that are particularly important for this project?
     [Django's admin interface is crucial for rapid development of the administrative panels. Its robust ORM will simplify complex queries for client management and report generation.]
   - What factors should be considered in making this decision?
     [Security features, scalability, and ease of maintenance are the primary considerations. Django's built-in protections against common vulnerabilities make it a better choice for a system handling sensitive client data.]

4. **PDF Form Mapping Implementation**
   - The requirements describe a complex PDF form mapping system. Please provide more details on:
     - How should the system handle dynamic field mapping for different insurance companies?
       [The system should use a template-based approach where admin users define mappings between standardized fields (as defined in standardized_fields.json) and specific form fields for each insurance company template. These mappings should be stored in a database and versioned.]
     - Are there any specific PDF libraries that have been tested and preferred?
       [PyPDFForm has been tested and works well with our requirements. It should be used as the primary library, with pdftk as a fallback for more complex form manipulations.]
     - What is the expected workflow for administrators to set up new form mappings?
       [Admins should be able to upload a new PDF template, view all available form fields automatically extracted from the PDF, then create mappings between standardized fields and PDF form fields through a drag-and-drop interface. The system should allow saving these mappings as reusable templates.]
     - Will there be a need to support batch updates to field mappings?
       [Yes, admins should be able to update mappings across multiple forms simultaneously when standardized fields change or are added. This is especially important for maintaining consistency across insurance company templates.]

5. **Data Migration**
   - Is there an existing system (v1) with data that needs to be migrated?
     [Yes, there is a v1 system with approximately 5,000 client records and 15,000 generated forms that need to be migrated to the new system.]
   - What is the expected volume of data to be migrated?
     [Approximately 5,000 client records, 15,000 generated PDF forms, and 20 form templates with their associated field mappings.]
   - Are there any specific data transformation requirements during migration?
     [Client data needs to be restructured to match the new standardized fields schema. Some fields need to be split (e.g., full address into component parts) and others combined (e.g., separate name fields into full name).]
   - What is the expected strategy for validating the migrated data?
     [A two-phase validation approach: first, automated validation to ensure all required fields are populated and properly formatted; second, manual sampling of 5% of migrated records by operations staff to verify accuracy.]

## LLM Integration

6. **LLM Integration Details**
   - Which LLM API is preferred or has been selected for client data extraction?
     [OpenAI's GPT-4 API is the preferred choice, with Google Gemini as a backup option.]
   - Are there any specific budget constraints or rate limitations to consider?
     [The monthly budget for LLM API usage is capped at $2,000. We should implement rate limiting to prevent unexpected costs and cache frequent requests.]
   - What is the expected fallback strategy if the LLM service is unavailable?
     [The system should gracefully degrade to manual data entry with form guidance based on the standardized field definitions. A local cache of common extraction patterns should also be maintained.]
   - How should the system handle extraction errors or low-confidence extractions?
     [Fields with confidence below 80% should be highlighted for user review. The system should provide suggestions based on pattern matching and allow users to correct or confirm the extracted data.]
   - What level of user intervention is acceptable in the extraction process?
     [Users should expect to review 20-30% of extracted fields, primarily for complex or unique client data. The system should learn from corrections to improve future extractions.]

## Risk Management

7. **Potential Challenges and Contingencies**
   - What are the most critical features that must work correctly for the system to be considered successful?
     [PDF form generation with accurate field mapping, client data management, and secure user authentication are the most critical features. Without these, the system cannot fulfill its core purpose.]
   - Are there any known technical challenges from previous versions that should be addressed?
     [The v1 system had performance issues when generating multiple PDF forms simultaneously and problems with Chinese character rendering in some PDF forms. These must be addressed in v2.0.]
   - What is the contingency plan if certain features prove more difficult to implement than anticipated?
     [For complex features, we will implement a phased approach with core functionality first, followed by enhancements. If LLM extraction proves challenging, we'll focus on improving the manual data entry experience first.]
   - How should the team prioritize features if time constraints become an issue?
     [Priority order: 1) Authentication and security, 2) Client data management, 3) PDF form generation, 4) LLM integration, 5) Advanced admin features, 6) Reporting and analytics.]

## Additional Requirements Clarification

8. **User Experience Expectations**
   - Are there any specific performance requirements for the PDF form generation process?
     [PDF form generation should complete within 5 seconds per form. Batch generation of up to 10 forms should complete within 30 seconds.]
   - What is the expected response time for client data extraction using the LLM?
     [LLM extraction should return results within 10 seconds for a standard client document. Users should see a progress indicator during extraction.]
   - Are there any preferences for the UI/UX design (e.g., specific design system or style guide)?
     [The UI should follow Material Design principles with a clean, professional appearance. The color scheme should use blue (#1976D2) as the primary color with white backgrounds for good readability.]

9. **Testing Requirements**
   - What types of testing are expected (unit, integration, end-to-end)?
     [All three types are required: unit tests for individual components, integration tests for API endpoints and services, and end-to-end tests for critical user flows like authentication, client creation, and PDF generation.]
   - Is there a preferred testing framework or approach?
     [Jest for frontend testing, pytest for backend testing, and Cypress for end-to-end testing.]
   - What level of test coverage is expected?
     [Minimum 80% code coverage overall, with critical modules (authentication, PDF generation, client data management) requiring 90% coverage.]
   - Will there be a dedicated QA phase, or should testing be integrated throughout development?
     [Testing should be integrated throughout development with CI/CD pipelines, but there will also be a 2-week dedicated QA phase before each major release.]

10. **Deployment and DevOps**
    - What is the preferred cloud provider for deployment?
      [AWS is the preferred cloud provider, with the application deployed using ECS (Elastic Container Service) and RDS for PostgreSQL database.]
    - Are there any specific security requirements or compliance standards that must be met?
      [The system must comply with PDPO (Personal Data Privacy Ordinance) for Hong Kong and implement industry-standard security measures including encryption at rest and in transit, regular security audits, and proper access controls.]
    - Is there an existing CI/CD pipeline that should be utilized?
      [Yes, we have an existing GitHub Actions pipeline that should be extended for this project. It currently handles testing and deployment to staging environments.]
    - What monitoring solutions should be implemented?
      [AWS CloudWatch for infrastructure monitoring, Sentry for error tracking, and Prometheus/Grafana for application performance monitoring. Daily automated health checks for all critical services.]
